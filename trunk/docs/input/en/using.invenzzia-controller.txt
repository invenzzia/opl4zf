Title: Invenzzia_Controller

----

The `Invenzzia_Controller` component provides the new action class that should be used by your action controllers, if you are going to use [Invenzzia_Layout][using.invenzzia-layout]:

~~~~
[php]
class IndexController extends Invenzzia_Controller_Action
{
	public function indexAction()
	{
		$this->view->variable = 'foo';
	} // end indexAction();
} // end IndexController;
~~~~

The new base action controller provides the new controller property: `$this->view` which gives you the access to the view of the currently rendered action. It is created automatically.
