Title: title
Construct: helper

----

Helps managing and displaying the page title. The title is constructed from smaller parts separated with the user-defined string, for example a slash.

Action usage
============

The title parts can be appended or prepended in the action code with the helper object:

~~~~
[php]
$titleHelper = Invenzzia_View_HelperBroker::getInstance()->title;
$titleHelper->appendTitle('Appended title');
$titleHelper->prependTitle('Prepended title');
~~~~

To set the title separator, we use `setSeparator()`:

~~~~
[php]
$titleHelper->setSeparator(' / ');
~~~~

The helper allows to set the default title which is presented, if there are no title parts added by the actions:

~~~~
[php]
$titleHelper->setDefaultTitle('This is a default title');
~~~~

We can also reset the current title parts with `reset()`.

Template usage
==============

The helper is very simple in use on the template-side:

~~~~
[xml]
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{$helper.title}</title>
  </head>
</html>
~~~~
