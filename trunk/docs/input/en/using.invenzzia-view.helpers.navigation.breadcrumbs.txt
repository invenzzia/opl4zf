Title: breadcrumbs
Construct: helper
SeeAlso:
 - using.invenzzia-view.helpers.navigation.navigation-tree

----

The helper displays the breadcrumbs from a `Zend_Navigation` container.

The idea
========

Breadcrumbs give the users a way to keep track of their location within a website. They are usually displayed in a form of a horizontal bar, showing the most general parts of the website on the left, and the currently viewed document on the right, for example:

~~~~
Example.com / Articles / Technology / Using Zend Framework with OPL
~~~~

This helper uses the `Zend_Navigation` component to recognize the application structure, determine, which page is currently displayed and provide a path from the website root page to it.

Action usage
============

The basic configuration of the helper is described in [Navigation helpers][using.invenzzia-view.helpers.navigation]. The breadcrumb helper extends it with setting the item separator:

~~~~
[php]
$breadcrumbs->setSeparator(' / ');
~~~~

Template usage
==============

The breadcrumb bar can be generated automatically:

~~~~
[xml]
<p>{u:$helper.breadcrumbs}</p>
~~~~

You may also take the control over the process with the `breadcrumbs` section to use website-specific HTML code:

~~~~
[xml]
<opt:selector name="breadcrumbs" str:separator=" / ">
	<opt:current>{$breadcrumbs.label}</opt:current>
	<opt:default><a parse:href="$breadcrumbs.attr.href">{$breadcrumbs.label}</a></opt:default>
</opt:selector>
~~~~

The `$breadcrumbs.attr` container contains a list of link attributes. If you wish to display them all, you may use `opt:attributes-build` attribute.
