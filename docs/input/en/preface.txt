Title: Preface

----

Open Power Libs is a set of specialized PHP5 libraries designed to help you developing the applications. They are neither a framework nor a solution created for a certain framework. The libraries provide their own core, error handling or plugin architecture that allows you to extend them, and you can use them either as a standalone product or together with your favourite framework.

The Open Power Libs port for [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com) is a official port that allows you to easily integrate these libraries with Zend Framework, a product of Zend Company Ltd. It replaces or extends some of the default framework components so that they make use of the libraries provided by OPL. Currently, the project focuses on providing a complete support for Open Power Template 2 engine, a part of OPL project.

Features
========

Currently, the port provides the following changes and improvements to the original Zend Framework:

 - Introduction of `Opt_View` class, the base view class in Open Power Template 2.
 - `Invenzzia_Layout` component, a replacement for `Zend_Layout` designed especially for OPT.
 - New response class, compatible with the OPT output system interface.
 - `Zend_Mail` extended in order to generate the message body from a template.
 - `Zend_Form` extended in order to use the OPT form building tools.
 - Router functions and instructions for the template engine.
 - The access to the original Zend Framework view helpers.
 - The original Open Power Libs error handler extended to support Zend Framework exceptions.
 - Basic `Zend_Cache` integration with Open Power Template.
